# <img src="/favicon.png" width="32" height="32"> Overview

This library is a collection of styles to help you build your Avalonia app with a ready to go Neumorphism Design theme.

This Avalonia UI Neumorphic theme was inspired by another great Avalonia UI theme : [Material.Avalonia] (https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Material.Avalonia)

As neumorphism has no official specifications, this is my own personal interpretation of Neumorphism general guidelines i found on the web (mainly on Dribble).

It also uses some elements of Material Design such as :
- Primary and Secondary (Accent) color with light and dark variants
- A light theme and a dark theme (you can switch between them at runtime)
- Material Design Icons (must be installed separately)

For the moment only the following controls are fully themed :
- Buttons
- ToggleButtons
- RadioButtons
- Checkboxes
- Textboxes
- Comboboxes

More controls should be themed soon.
